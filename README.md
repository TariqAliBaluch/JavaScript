<h1>My JavaScript Learning Journey</h1>

This is my JavaScript learning repository. I created it to practice and improve my skills in JavaScript by writing small programs, exercises, and mini projects. As a student, I’m using this space to try out different concepts like variables, functions, loops, arrays, and more. This repo helps me keep track of my progress and experiment with code as I learn. The projects included here are simple and made to build my understanding step by step. I’ll continue updating it as I learn new things!
